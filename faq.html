            This page answers some of the questions we’re most often asked by organisations exploring support from 
            Oak Consultancy. If you can’t find what you’re looking for, you’re very welcome to get in touch.

      <div class="container">
        <div class="card">
          <h2 id="faq-billing-title">Billing, pricing &amp; packages</h2>

          <h3>How does billing work?</h3>
          <p>
            Most organisations work with us through one of our support packages, which are billed monthly. Packages are 
            usually agreed for 12 months to allow enough time for planning, funding applications and follow-up.
          </p>

          <h3>What’s included in the monthly price?</h3>
          <p>
            Each package includes a set number of consultancy hours and access to support across bid writing, strategic 
            planning and tender management. How those hours are used is agreed with you and tracked so you can see where 
            time is going.
          </p>

          <h3>Are there any additional costs?</h3>
          <p>
            If work is required beyond the agreed package hours, we will always discuss this with you first and agree 
            a clear hourly rate. There are no hidden charges.
          </p>

          <h3>Do you offer one-off pieces of work?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes. While packages suit many organisations, we can also provide support for a single bid, tender or planning 
            process. We will discuss the best option during an initial conversation.
          </p>

      <div class="container">
        <div class="card">
          <h2 id="faq-timelines-title">Timelines &amp; how long things take</h2>

          <h3>How long does a typical bid take?</h3>
          <p>
            It depends on the size and complexity of the fund. A small, straightforward grant might only require a 
            short call and a few days of work, whereas a larger or more complex fund can take several weeks from first 
            conversation to submission.
          </p>

          <h3>How far in advance should we contact you?</h3>
          <p>
            The earlier the better, especially for larger bids or tenders. Ideally, we like to start several weeks 
            before a deadline to allow for shaping the project, drafting, review and final checks.
          </p>

          <h3>How long does strategic planning support take?</h3>
          <p>
            A focused project plan might be developed over a few sessions, while an organisation-wide plan usually 
            takes longer and may involve several workshops and drafts. We can suggest a sensible timeframe once we 
            understand your context.

    <!-- Information we need -->

      <div class="container">
        <div class="card">
          <h2 id="faq-info-title">Information we need from your organisation</h2>

          <h3>What do you need from us to get started?</h3>
          <p>
            For most pieces of work, we will ask for basic information about your organisation (such as governing 
            documents, contact details and recent accounts) plus any existing project ideas or plans.
          </p>

          <h3>Will you need access to our policies and reports?</h3>
          <p>
            Often, yes. Funders and commissioners frequently ask for policies (e.g. safeguarding, data protection) 
            and evidence of impact. We will let you know exactly what is required for each bid or tender.
          </p>

          <h3>How much time will our staff or volunteers need to commit?</h3>
          <p>
            You will still need to be involved, particularly at the start of a project and when reviewing drafts. 
            We aim to keep requests focused and manageable, so you can balance this with day-to-day delivery.

    <!-- Success rates & expectations -->

      <div class="container">
        <div class="card">
          <h2 id="faq-success-title">Success rates &amp; expectations</h2>

          <h3>Can you guarantee that our bids will be successful?</h3>
          <p>
            No consultant can guarantee funding outcomes, as final decisions are made by funders or commissioners. 
            What we can do is ensure that bids are clear, eligible, realistic and well-presented, and that learning 
            from previous applications is used to strengthen future ones.
          </p>

          <h3>How should we think about success?</h3>
          <p>
            Success is not only about individual bids being approved. It can also include building a stronger funding 
            pipeline, improving the way you describe your work, clarifying priorities and reducing the stress around 
            deadlines.
          </p>

          <h3>Will you tell us if something doesn’t feel realistic?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes. Part of our role is to be honest about whether a bid or tender feels like a good use of time based on 
            your capacity, track record and the requirements involved.

          <h2 id="faq-tenders-title">Tender and bid support in practice</h2>

          <h3>How do you support tender responses?</h3>
          <p>
            We help you assess whether an opportunity is realistic, plan the response, coordinate information, draft 
            and refine content, and carry out final checks before submission. You remain in control of decisions; we 
            provide structure and support.
          </p>

          <h3>Can you just review bids we’ve already written?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes. We can review and comment on bids you’ve drafted in-house, suggesting ways to strengthen clarity, 
            alignment to criteria and overall coherence.
          </p>

          <h3>Do you work with very small organisations?</h3>
          <p>
            Absolutely. Many of the organisations we support are volunteer-run or have very small staff teams. We tailor 
            our approach to the time and resources you have available.
