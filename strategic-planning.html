            Many boards and committees know broadly where they want to go, but struggle to turn that into clear,
            realistic plans that staff and funders can follow. Oak Consultancy supports you to agree priorities,
            make choices and capture a plan that feels achievable.

            The exact shape of the work depends on your organisation, but a typical piece of strategic planning support
            might include:
          </p>

          <h3>1. Listening and discovery</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Conversations with trustees, senior staff, volunteers or key partners.</li>
            <li>Review of existing plans, reports, evaluations or funding applications.</li>
            <li>Understanding your context: community, funding environment and constraints.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>2. Clarifying purpose and priorities</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Helping you articulate your core purpose and who you are here to serve.</li>
            <li>Agreeing a small number of clear priorities instead of a long wish-list.</li>
            <li>Considering what to stop, pause or delay as well as what to start.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>3. Developing a realistic plan</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Turning priorities into outcomes, activities and milestones.</li>
            <li>Identifying the people, time and resources required.</li>
            <li>Agreeing what success will look like and how it will be measured.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>4. Aligning plans with funding</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Mapping your plan against potential funding and income streams.</li>
            <li>Identifying where grants, contracts or trading income might fit.</li>
            <li>Ensuring that future bids align with your agreed priorities, not just what’s available.</li>

          <p class="section-intro">
            We keep planning grounded in reality and designed around the time you genuinely have.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Initial conversation.</strong> We discuss why you are considering planning now, who needs to be
              involved and what decisions you hope to make.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Agree scope and approach.</strong> Together we decide whether to focus on the whole organisation
              or a specific project or area of work.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Workshops or meetings.</strong> Oak Consultancy facilitates structured discussions with trustees,
              staff or volunteers to surface ideas, concerns and priorities.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Drafting the plan.</strong> We summarise what we’ve heard into a clear, practical document with
              priorities, actions and timeframes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Review and refine.</strong> You review the draft, we adjust language and detail so it feels like
              your organisation’s voice.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Next steps and funding links.</strong> We highlight where the plan connects to funding or tender
              opportunities and suggest sensible next actions.

          <h2 id="sp-benefits-title">Benefits of having a clear, shared plan</h2>
          <p class="section-intro">
            A good plan doesn’t sit on a shelf. It gives your organisation a shared reference point for decisions.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Trustees and staff have a common understanding of direction and priorities.</li>
            <li>Funding bids are more consistent and clearly linked to agreed plans.</li>
            <li>It’s easier to say “not now” to opportunities that don’t fit.</li>
            <li>Progress can be reviewed in a structured way, rather than reactively.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            We focus on producing something you will actually use: clear, readable and grounded in your day-to-day
            reality.

          <h2 id="sp-faq-title">Frequently asked questions</h2>

          <h3>Do we need to have everything decided before we start?</h3>
          <p>
            No. The planning process is there to help you clarify and agree priorities. It’s very common to start with
            broad ideas and refine them together.
          </p>

          <h3>Who needs to be involved?</h3>
          <p>
            That depends on your structure, but most plans benefit from input from trustees or board members, key staff
            and sometimes volunteers or partners. We can advise on a sensible mix.
          </p>

          <h3>Can you help us update an existing plan?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes. If you already have a plan that is out of date or no longer reflects reality, we can use it as a
            starting point and refresh it rather than beginning again from scratch.
          </p>

          <h3>Will the plan be suitable to share with funders?</h3>
          <p>
            We aim to create plans that are useful both internally and externally. Many organisations share elements of
            their plan with funders to demonstrate clarity of purpose and direction.
