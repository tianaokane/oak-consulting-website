            Many organisations are doing excellent work but struggle to find time—and the right words—to explain it
            to funders. Oak Consultancy helps you identify realistic funding opportunities and prepare clear, honest
            bids that show the difference you make.

            This service is a good fit if you are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A charity, community group, school, sports club, church, social enterprise or CIC.</li>
            <li>Delivering work that clearly benefits people or communities.</li>
            <li>Short on time or confidence when it comes to writing applications.</li>
            <li>Frustrated by “almost there” or repeated unsuccessful bids.</li>

            You don’t need to have a perfect project plan written up. If you have a rough idea of what you want to do,
            we can help you shape it into something funders can understand and support.

            <li>Checking eligibility and guidance so time is not wasted on poor fits.</li>
            <li>Discussing which opportunities to prioritise based on capacity and timelines.</li>
          </ul>

          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Initial conversation.</strong> We talk through your organisation, current work and what you’d
              like to fund. You can also share any previous bids and feedback.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Agree focus and priorities.</strong> Together we decide which bid(s) to tackle first, based on
              deadlines, fit and capacity.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Information gathering.</strong> We request key documents and details (e.g. budgets, project
              ideas, existing reports) so we can write accurately.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Drafting and review.</strong> Oak Consultancy prepares a draft bid. You review, correct and
              add detail where needed; we then refine and finalise.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Submission.</strong> We support you to submit on time, ensuring the application and any
              attachments are complete and consistent.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Learning and follow-up.</strong> Where funders provide feedback, we review it with you and use
              it to strengthen future bids.

          <h2 id="bid-faq-title">Frequently asked questions</h2>

          <h3>How far in advance do we need to contact you?</h3>
          <p>
            Ideally, several weeks before the deadline so there is time to shape the project, gather information and
            go through at least one round of review. Tight deadlines may still be possible, but options can be more
            limited.
          </p>

          <h3>Can you guarantee a successful outcome?</h3>
          <p>
            No consultant can guarantee funding, as decisions ultimately sit with funders. What we can do is ensure
            your bids are clear, eligible, realistic and well-presented, and help you learn from any unsuccessful
            attempts.
          </p>

          <h3>Do we have to commit to a full package?</h3>
          <p>
            Not necessarily. While many organisations prefer a package for ongoing support, we can also discuss
            one-off pieces of work for specific bids or time-limited projects.
          </p>

          <h3>What information will you need from us?</h3>
          <p>
            Typically we’ll ask for basic organisational information, project ideas, any existing plans or reports,
            recent accounts and a sense of your current capacity. We’ll keep the requests as focused and manageable as
            we can.
