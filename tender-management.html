            Tenders can feel daunting: long documents, strict requirements, tight deadlines and online portals that
            don’t always feel intuitive. Oak Consultancy helps you spot realistic opportunities and manage the whole
            response process in a structured, calm way.

            This service is a good fit if you are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A charity, social enterprise, CIC, community organisation or small business.</li>

          </ul>
          <p>
            You do not need to be an experienced tender bidder to start. We can help you understand what’s realistic,

            We aim to make a complex process feel as manageable and structured as possible.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Initial discussion.</strong> We talk through the tender opportunity (or type of tenders you’re
              interested in) and your capacity to deliver the work if successful.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Go/no-go decision.</strong> Based on the requirements and your position, we help you decide
              whether to proceed with a bid or not.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Response plan.</strong> We create a simple plan covering tasks, responsibilities and internal
              deadlines leading up to submission.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Content development.</strong> Oak Consultancy drafts or supports the drafting of the quality
              responses, aligning them with the specification and scoring criteria.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Review and refine.</strong> You review drafts, add detail and correct anything that doesn’t feel
              quite right; we refine and strengthen the final responses.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Submission and learning.</strong> We support you with the final upload and, where feedback is
              provided, we help interpret it for future improvements.

          <h2 id="tm-benefits-title">Benefits of structured tender support</h2>
          <p class="section-intro">
            Tenders will probably never feel “easy”, but a structured approach can make them far less stressful.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Reduced risk of missing key requirements or attachments.</li>
            <li>Clearer, more consistent responses that are easier for evaluators to follow.</li>
            <li>Less last-minute panic, where timescales allow.</li>
            <li>Better understanding of whether tenders are the right route for your organisation.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Even if you decide not to bid for a particular opportunity, the process can help clarify what you might
            need in place for future tenders.

            Tender support can be a one-off piece of work for a specific opportunity, or part of a broader package of

          <ul>
            <li>Support for a single, time-limited tender opportunity.</li>

            Packages start from £50 per month, with higher levels of support available if tenders are likely to be a
            significant part of your income strategy.

          <h2 id="tm-faq-title">Frequently asked questions</h2>

          <h3>Do you only support certain types of tenders?</h3>
          <p>
            We typically support community-focused, education, health, social care, sports and local authority tenders.
            If you have a specific opportunity in mind, we can discuss whether it’s a good fit.
          </p>

          <h3>How much time will we need to commit internally?</h3>
          <p>
            You will still need to be involved, particularly in supplying information, evidence and approvals. However,
            our role is to reduce the coordination and drafting load as much as possible.
          </p>

          <h3>Can you guarantee a successful tender?</h3>
          <p>
            No tender specialist can guarantee success, as decisions rest with commissioners and evaluators. We focus on
            ensuring your response is compliant, clear and competitive within those constraints.
          </p>

          <h3>What if we’re completely new to tenders?</h3>
          <p>
            That’s fine. We can start with a conversation about what tenders are, what they involve and whether they’re
            likely to suit your organisation at this stage.
