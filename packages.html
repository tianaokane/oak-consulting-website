            Some organisations just need a light-touch steer and occasional funding alerts. Others want a long-term

            Oak Consultancy’s packages are designed to be clear, flexible and realistic. All packages begin with an

          <p class="section-intro">
            The “right” package depends on how much internal capacity you have, how many projects you are running and
            how ambitious your funding targets are.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Choose Basic</strong> if you mainly need to stay informed about opportunities and want the option
              of occasional, paid bid-writing support.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Choose Standard</strong> if you expect to pursue several grants or tenders each year and want
              ongoing support with planning, writing and reporting.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Choose Premium</strong> if you want Oak Consultancy to act as a long-term partner, supporting
              board reporting, planning and a higher volume of bids.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If none of these feels quite right, we can discuss a tailored arrangement based on a specific project,
            timeframe or combination of services.
