            Oak Consultancy works with organisations of different sizes and structures – from small, volunteer-led groups 
            to more established charities and social enterprises. What they have in common is a desire to make a practical 
            difference and a need for clear, grounded support.

          <p class="intro-text">
            You don’t need to have everything figured out. If you know roughly where you want to get to, we can help you plan 
            the route and secure the funding to make it possible.

          <h2 id="charities-title">Charities &amp; community organisations</h2>
          <p class="section-intro">
            Many of the charities and community groups we work with are juggling day-to-day delivery with the pressure 
            to secure future funding. Time is tight, staff and volunteers wear multiple hats, and bid writing can feel 
            like “extra” work on top of everything else.
          </p>

          <h3>Typical challenges</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Knowing which funds to prioritise and which to ignore.</li>
            <li>Limited time to research and write applications.</li>
            <li>Uncertainty around how to evidence impact in the way funders expect.</li>
            <li>Frustration with “unsuccessful” outcomes but not knowing what to change.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            We help by identifying realistic opportunities, shaping clear, funder-friendly bids and building a pipeline of 
            funding that supports both core work and new projects.

          <h2 id="education-title">Schools, PTAs &amp; youth projects</h2>
          <p class="section-intro">
            Schools, PTAs and youth organisations often have strong ideas for how to support children and young people, 
            but limited capacity to turn those ideas into funded projects.
          </p>

          <h3>Typical challenges</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Finding funding that fits education or youth work settings.</li>
            <li>Translating project ideas into clear, costed proposals.</li>
            <li>Balancing curriculum, pastoral and extra-curricular priorities.</li>
            <li>Short timelines to respond to new opportunities.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Oak Consultancy can help you frame your work in ways that resonate with funders, build realistic budgets 
            and plan projects that are deliverable alongside existing commitments.

          <p class="section-intro">
            From local sports clubs to churches and social enterprises, many organisations are delivering significant 
            community impact without always describing it in “funding language”.
          </p>

          <h3>Typical challenges</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Explaining the wider social impact of activities that may seem purely sporting or faith-based.</li>
            <li>Understanding which funds are open to non-charities or different legal structures.</li>
            <li>Balancing trading income with grants and other funding streams.</li>
            <li>Responding to tender opportunities that could scale up your work.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            We help you surface the impact you are already having, identify suitable funds or tenders and prepare 
            bids that show how your work benefits the wider community.

            You don’t need to be a large organisation to work with us. Oak Consultancy may be a good fit if:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>You are delivering, or planning to deliver, work that benefits a local community or specific group.</li>
            <li>You have limited capacity in-house to keep on top of funding, strategy or tender deadlines.</li>
            <li>You want clear, honest feedback on what is realistic based on your time and resources.</li>
            <li>You value long-term relationships and support, not just a one-off bid.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If you are unsure whether your organisation fits, we are happy to have an initial conversation and advise you 
            on the best next steps – even if that is signposting you elsewhere.
