            Oak Consultancy exists to support organisations that are rooted in their communities – charities, community groups,
            schools, sports clubs, faith groups and social enterprises – to access the funding and strategic support they need
            to keep going and grow.
          </p>
          <p class="intro-text">
            We focus on practical, down-to-earth support: clear plans, realistic bids and calm guidance through what can feel
            like a complex system.

    <!-- Our story -->
    <section class="section" aria-labelledby="our-story-title">
      <div class="container">
        <div class="card">
          <h2 id="our-story-title">Our story</h2>
          <p class="section-intro">
            Oak Consultancy was founded by people who have seen first-hand how much time and energy community organisations
            put into their work – and how frustrating it can be when funding processes get in the way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, we’ve worked with charities, schools, clubs and social enterprises that are delivering excellent
            work but are stretched thin. Staff and volunteers juggle front-line delivery, governance, safeguarding, facilities,
            reporting and everything in between. Funding applications and tenders are often squeezed into evenings, weekends or
            the margins of the day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Oak Consultancy was set up to offer a different kind of support: practical, honest and tailored to the realities
            of smaller and mid-sized organisations, rather than assuming there is a dedicated fundraising or development team.

    <!-- Our approach -->

          <h2 id="our-approach-title">Our approach</h2>
          <p class="section-intro">
            We try to keep things as simple and grounded as possible.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Plain language, not jargon.</strong> We explain processes and funding requirements in clear terms, so you always know what’s happening and why.</li>
            <li><strong>Realistic, not idealistic.</strong> We work with the time and capacity you have, not an imaginary full team that doesn’t exist.</li>
            <li><strong>Honest conversations.</strong> If something isn’t realistic, or a fund isn’t a good fit, we will say so and explain why.</li>
            <li><strong>Long-term thinking.</strong> We aim to help you build a pipeline and a plan, not just chase one-off pots of money.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Above all, we aim to be a calm, reliable presence alongside your organisation – someone you can talk things through
            with, ask questions of and lean on when deadlines or decisions feel heavy.

          <article class="card">
            <h3>Clarity</h3>
            <p>
              We prioritise clear communication, straightforward documents and practical next steps. You should never be
              left wondering what happens next.

          </article>

          <article class="card">
            <h3>Integrity</h3>
            <p>
              We will only encourage bids and tenders that feel appropriate and realistic for your organisation. If we don’t
              think something is a good idea, we will explain our reasoning.

            <h3>Partnership</h3>
            <p>
              We see our work as a partnership, not a one-way service. Your knowledge of your community or sector, combined
              with our experience of funding and planning, is what makes the work effective.
