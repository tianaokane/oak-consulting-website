              <p class="section-intro">
                Oak Consultancy was founded by people who have seen first-hand how much time and energy
                community organisations pour into their work – and how frustrating it is when funding
                processes get in the way.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the years, we’ve worked with charities, schools, clubs and social enterprises that are
                delivering excellent work but are stretched thin. Staff and volunteers juggle front-line
                delivery, governance, safeguarding, facilities, reporting and everything in between.
                Funding applications and tenders are often squeezed into evenings, weekends or the margins of the day.
              </p>
              <p>
                Oak Consultancy was set up to offer a different kind of support: practical, honest and
                tailored to the realities of smaller and mid-sized organisations, rather than assuming
                there is a dedicated fundraising or development team.
