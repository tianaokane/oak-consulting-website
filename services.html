            Oak Consultancy focuses on three core areas: bid writing, strategic planning and tender management. 
            We keep things straightforward, remove the jargon and give you the support you actually need to move projects forward.
          </p>
          <p class="intro-text">
            Some organisations need a one-off piece of work. Others prefer ongoing, long-term support. 
            However you choose to work with us, our aim is the same: to save you time, reduce stress and improve your chances of success.

          Every organisation is different, so we start by understanding your context, capacity and goals.
